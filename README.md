ThreadAuction

Full stack React app with a Node backend and MySQL DB.

Ecommerce site with an auction system and user authentication. Products are displayed onsite with product details and auction information. Auctions expire one week after posting.

** Note to users **
Products are fake and not meant to be purchased. As of now, the date is hardcoded at 11/7/18, so that products will show on the homepage and throughout the site, since usually they would disappear as auctions expire (7 days). Please feel free to play around the site, create a login, bid on products, etc.
